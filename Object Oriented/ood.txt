Object Oriented Design

six W's - who, what, where, when, how, why

coffee machine - massive restaurant w/ hundreds of customers per hour,
10 different kinds of coffee products, or just a simple machine?

OOD - restaurant - objects: Table, Guest, Party, Order, Meal, Employee,
  Server, Host

1. Handle Ambiguity - ask clarifying questions
2. Define the Core Objects
3. Analyze Relationships
  -Party has an array of Guests
  -Server and Host inherit from Employee
  -Each Table has one Party but each Party may have multiple Tables
  -There is one Host for each Restaurant

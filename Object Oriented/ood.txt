Object Oriented Design

six W's - who, what, where, when, how, why

coffee machine - massive restaurant w/ hundreds of customers per hour,
10 different kinds of coffee products, or just a simple machine?

OOD - restaurant - objects: Table, Guest, Party, Order, Meal, Employee,
  Server, Host

1. Handle Ambiguity - ask clarifying questions
2. Define the Core Objects
3. Analyze Relationships
  -Party has an array of Guests
  -Server and Host inherit from Employee
  -Each Table has one Party but each Party may have multiple Tables (or
  do you have communal tables with multiple parties?)
  -There is one Host for each Restaurant
4. Investigate Actions - key actions for objects and how they relate to each other
  - Party walks into Restaurant
  - Guest requests Table from Host
  - Host looks up Reservation - assigns Party to a Table
  - Otherwise Party is added to end of the List

Design Patterns
- Singleton Class - class only has one instance - ensures access to that
instance across the application.
  Con - can interfere with Unit Testing

- Factory Method - an interface for creating an instance of the class

Classes
You can think of a class as a recipe or description of a type of object.

Objects - collection of data and functions
An object is a specific instance of a class.

Method vs. Function
The term method is used almost exclusively in object-oriented programming.
A function is something that takes a bunch of inputs and returns one or more values.

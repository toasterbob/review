Data structures - array, hash, string

Abstract Data Type (ADT)

- set
  include?, << (shovel), delete
  can't include duplicates
  you can implement a set with a hash map - value could equal true
  inserting into a set when something exists, nothing happens

- map / dictionary
  set (key, value), get (k), delete(k)
  map is just a set of key value pairs

- stack
  two operations: push and pop
  LIFO
  things on top are the most recent
  stack of cafeteria trays being wet
  not fair
  use an array with only push and pop. implements a stack.
  STACK IS USED DURING RECURSION
  implicit in any recursive algorithm

- queue
  enqueue and dequeue
  FIFO
  totally fair
  push(for enqueue) and shift(dequeue)
  or unshift(for enqueue) and pop (dequeue)

- tree
  most common type is a binary tree
  parent/child relationship
  called binary tree because each node (or vertex) has at most two children
  every node has at most one parent (it can have no parents)
  single node is a tree
  empty tree is still a tree

Data structures - array, hash, string

Abstract Data Type (ADT)

- set
  include?, << (shovel), delete
  can't include duplicates
  you can implement a set with a hash map - value could equal true
  inserting into a set when something exists, nothing happens

- map / dictionary
  set (key, value), get (k), delete(k)
  map is just a set of key value pairs

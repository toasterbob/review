//What is the DOM?

// The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML,
// XML and SVG documents. It provides a structured representation of the document as a tree.

// The DOM provides a representation of the document as a structured group
// of nodes and objects, possessing various properties and methods. Nodes
// can also have event handlers attached to them, and once an event is
// triggered, the event handlers get executed. Essentially, it connects web
// pages to scripts or programming languages.

// To access the DOM, we make use of the document object. This object has
// properties and functions that we use to access our HTML elements which
// we can manipulate with JavaScript.

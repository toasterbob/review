Internet - rules and standards so computers can communicate with each other
Servers were just remote file systems in the 90s

Hypertext Transfer Protocol - HTTP
FTP - uploading files to the server

web is stateless - by default it doesn't remember anything - data doesn't persist
request to request

database to preserve state

Browser only knows HTML, CSS, JS.  Servers are more flexible

Clients do not communicate directly with databases

Microservice architecture - each server manages a different service
Decentralize - easier to have different teams on the code base

Monolithic - one giant app

Uber/Lyft - cars microservice, payment, user information
JSON Web Token - JWT - used to persist authentication across different services



Domain Name System - DNS - phone book for the internet - browser might be cacheing the address
Entire network of DNS servers

Unit testing is a software development process in which the smallest
testable parts of an application, called units, are individually and
independently scrutinized for proper operation. Unit testing can be done
manually but is often automated.

Integration testing, also known as integration and testing (I&T), is a
software development process which program units are combined and tested
as groups in multiple ways. In this context, a unit is defined as the
smallest testable part of an application.

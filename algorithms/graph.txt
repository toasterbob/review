Graphs

Vertices - dots
Edges - lines connecting them

Edges can be weighted or directional

Density = Edges/vert * (vert - 1)
max density of 1
min density is 0

max density changes on a directed graph - max density is 2
in edges and out edges

Facebook - no direction to edges
Twitter - directional - you can follow or be followed independently

Subgraphs with high density - nuclear family - everyone is connected to each other

If density is close to 1 - algorithm can run very slow
Sparse graph can come close to linear time with algorithms

Tree example - DOM

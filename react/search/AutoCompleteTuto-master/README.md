# AutoCompleteTuto
A tutorial of how to create autocomplete within reactJs


Plug and play:

You can initialize a standalone express server: 
- Run "npm install" at the root folder (you need to install NPM before), it will
create "node_modules" folder.
- Run "node index.js"

It is done (in theory...)  :)

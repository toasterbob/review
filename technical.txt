Architecture

Standard Web App Architecture

Basic Pieces

Browser
  Relational - join tables
    Denormalize - can speed it up

  NoSQL

  Failover - Prevent a single point of failure, Leader and followers

  Scaling a Relational Database
    high read load (e.g. Twitter / Facebook)
    Leader has many followers.  Followers send reads. Only leader can write to keep things in sync.

    high write load, then shard
      Not good for Relational DB.

    easy to undo: among the reasons why it's popular among startups

Load balancer
Application servers
Caching layer
  Caches are generally stored in memory (e.g. RAM) - e.g. Redis and Memcached

CDN(s)
  Giant data centers designed to send big files to users and to their ISPs as fast as possible

Database
